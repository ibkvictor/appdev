                	Welcome,
                    I am Ezekiel Victor, the author of this site. Through the course of this site, I would run you through a bit of myself. Once again you are welcome.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    First,
                I would like to start with the fact that I am very enthuasistic about progamming. So far, I program in C, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
                </p>
                <p>
                Also, I love reading, to me, to me books are  repositories of approaches to life that have been discovered by someone. Authors act like trainers, ready to share the trick towards achieving something.
